### A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? 

The artifacts are folders that were linked to the project through visual studios in order to have the project automatically retrieve these files during the operation. These files were header files, vs and fs files, jpg, and png files. The include folder I linked to the project contained many header files, which included mathematics from GLM, camera.h file, a 3D cylinder design file, etc. Along with the include folder, I also created an image folder, which contained the jpg and png files, and a shaderfile folder, which contained the vs and fs files. The two folders were placed in the main folder of the project and the files are automatically retrieved by the project instead of the project having to go through the computer to find these files. These folders were created at the beginning of this term in order for me to keep the entire project organized and to also have all the required files together with the project just in case it needed to be sent as a zip folder either by email or uploaded onto the internet.

### B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? 

I selected these items because these are the external files / folders that my project used in order to run properly. I had run into issues with having my files spread out on my computer when it came to running my program and also delivering my program to my professor. For example, if any of the files or folders were modified, the pathway to retrieve the data would malfunction and cause an error / failure in my project. Also, once I had sent the project over to my professor for a review, a lot of the files were missing, or the professor had to relink the pathways together in order for my project to work. 

These types of errors are not a large issue when it comes to working on a project by yourself, but when it comes to working with a team, these errors can cause a halt in production because the files are not attached with the main branch. I believe this showed my ability to be able to implement many different files whether created by myself, a team member, or an external party into my project very easily by just dropping the files into one directory instead of including multiple directories like we did in CS 330. Being able to make projects simple is a standard practice for new programmers and experienced ones. In the area below, I placed examples on how easy it was for my project to find certain files already included in the file by comparing a linker error. Please see arrows for the differences in photos.

### C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? 

The enhancement did meet my plans for my enhancement because I can now easily implement many different files such as vertexbuffer and staticmesh3D header files into my project by just dropping it into the include folder without having to implement it into my project. For my updates, I have found the header files needed to add music to my project from irrklang. I was able to easily place the header files into the project. The header files for irrklang are not being implemented yet, but they are also not taking space in the header files area of visual studios in the project.

### D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?


When modifying my artifact, I learned it was a lot easier to implement new files into my project by adding the header files into the include folder because the include folder was already linked to my project. I did not have to add the header files into the actual project in visual studios because the project automatically retrieved the files since they were in the main project. One issue I had when I re-started my project was, I ran into libraries and files that were corrupted or malfunctioning since my original project used x32 and visual studios 2019 during my CS 330 class. For my CS 499, I had to use my own personal device instead of using Apporto virtual lab and I had to download visual studios 2022 with windows x64. This caused an issue with my linkers, directories, and libraries because I was using a different windows architecture than what was previously used. 

## Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structure -

### A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? 

The artifacts that I added and modified to my project were header files and cpp files. The cpp and header files staticMesh3D and vertexBufferObject were implemented with the main.cpp and cylinder files in order to make the 3D designs inside my 3D world have better quality. These files were created approximately in 2014, but I found these files prior to my CS 499 class because I wanted to add to my project. The other file I modified was my main.cpp file and my camera.h file. The camera.h file was found on learnopengl site, during my CS 330 class. I modified these files in order to add new commands to my project. In my previous version of my project, the camera was only able to go left, right, forward, and backwards with the use of the keyboards and GLFW library. In the newer version, I added the camera to be able to move up and down as well.

### B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? 


I selected these items because the 3D designs’ textures in the older version of my project were grainy, watery, and not correctly aligned. I was also having an issue with implementing images with higher pixels into my 3D designs and I had to go with lower quality imagery to complete the project. I also added new commands to the camera movement because I did not like how I had to use the scroll along with combining keyboard commands to make the camera view go up and down. These combinations of commands sometimes made my view of the 3D world at an unacceptable angle. The following are two photos comparing the 3D designs’ textures from the older and newer version of my project: 

I believe these showed my abilities to locate open-source code and implementing the open-source code to my already created project by modifying it to fit with my original written code. The implemented code allowed me to update and upgrade my project to show and create better 3D design textures for any future project. The implementation of these additional codes and commands allows me or anyone using my open-source original code to have higher quality 3D texture designs with only making simple modifications within my original code to create a new 3D world by only having to worry about changing the vertices, indices, and image files. 

### C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? 


The enhancement to my project by implementing additional header files and cpp files worked great. These files caused the 3D world and objects to looker higher in quality than my previous version of the project. I will be using header files from the learnopengl website 2D design to add sound affects and music to my 3D design to make my project seem more like a video game level than just an 3D art piece. The header files and cpp files have already been downloaded from irrklang opensource and I will be implementing them into my project.

### D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?


I learned I could enhance the design of my project by adding these open-source header files and cpp files. An issue I ran into when implementing these files were running into errors such as linker 2019 Microsoft errors. I placed the header files into the include folder and the cpp files into the main project, I also went into the header files and the cpp files to modify the codes on their pathway and their implementation into the main project. After modifying these areas, the project exe file worked like a charm.


## Enhancement 3: Databases -

### A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? 


The artifacts that I re-modified to my project were the libraries for GLFW, GLM, GLEW, and GLAD. Earlier versions of these libraries were used in an earlier version of my OpenGL project, and I added the newer versions of these libraries during the start of CS 499.

### B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? 


I added the newer versions of these libraries to my project for three major reasons. The first reason was because the older versions of these libraries were corrupted and prevented me from opening my project due to libraries such as opengl32.lib or glu32.lib. The second reason for updating the libraries was because I was able to add more features to my project such as GLAD allowing me to implement openGL version 4.5 instead of openGL 3.3 in my project, which allowed the project to have a better resolution. Also, the updated GLM library allowed an update on the mathematics being provided to the project. Lastly, the updated libraries for GLFW and GLEW allowed me to implement my project into visual studios 2022 instead of visual studios 2019, which allowed me to use a newer SDK version. I was also able to use the newer version of GLFW and GLEW to update my project from a x32 or 32-CPU system to a x64 or 64 CPU system, which allows my project to run faster and have better overall performance. The updates of these libraries allowed me to show my skills to use additional resources to find developed libraries to upgrade and update an already developed project to enhance it instead of starting over from scratch. I was also able to use other programs to help build the lib files such as using cMaker to develop the lib files for GLFW.

### C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? 


The updating of the library files did meet my enhancement to change my project from a x32 bit to a x64 bit because it allowed my project to run faster by allocating more than 4GB of Ram while the project was running. Next, the updates allowed me to fix the corrupted lib files and they allowed my project to run with no errors.

### D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?


During this enhancement, I ran into a challenge with the GLFW library when using a x64 binary to create the lib files. In order to properly create these lib files, I used cMaker to develop a build for the GLFW library and linked the library to the 2022 visual studios. I learned my libraries had to be updated in my project because I was using a newer version of visual studios and without updating these libraries, my project ran into multiple errors and failures due to linker issues.
